\title{Generate the html for rmd files with interactive figures}
\usage{
generate_html_4_interactive_rmd(nms)
}
\arguments{
\item{nms}{The NMS sanctuary, with only "cinms" currently doing anything.}
}
\value{
The function outputs a html file for every rmd file containing interactive figures.
}
\description{
Rmd files with interactive figures present a special problem in terms of rendering
them into html. The problem is that, if one uses the markdown library to
create the html, the figures will turn out fine but the glossary tooltip functionality
will be missing. This tooltip functionality is created by the function rmd2html,
described in this package. If one uses rmd2html to render a rmd file containing
interactive figures, the tooltips will turn out fine but the figures won't show
up. The problem with rmd2html is that the appropriate javascript libraries are
not loaded into the resulting <head> section of the final html. This function
solves the problem (thereby producing html with both working figures and tooltips)
by rendering the rmd using both the markdown and rmd2html approaches and then rewriting
the <head> section of the rmd2html version with the markdown version.
