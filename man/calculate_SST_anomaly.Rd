\description{
This function calculates the SST anomaly for every month of SST data and then
writes that out to a csv file that will later be used to produce a SST anomaly figure. The
approach used here is based on \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13757}{Reed et al. 2016, Nature Communications}.
Using the first 15 full years of data from the SST data set (2003-2017), an average SST value is
generated for every month of the year. Then the average SST value for the appropriate month is
subtracted from every value in the SST dataset.
